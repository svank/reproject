**********************************
Regular celestial images and cubes
**********************************

One of the most common types of data to reproject are celestial images or
n-dimensional data (such as spectral cubes) where two of the axes are
celestial. There are several existing algorithms that can be used to
reproject such data:

* **Interpolation** (such as nearest-neighbor, bilinear, biquadratic
  interpolation and so on). This is the fastest algorithm and is suited to
  common use cases, but it is important to note that it is not flux
  conserving, and will not return optimal results if the input and output
  pixel sizes are very different.

* **Drizzling**, which consists of determining the exact overlap fraction of
  pixels, and optionally allows pixels to be rescaled before reprojection.
  A description of the algorithm can be found in
  `Fruchter and Hook (2002) <http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/338393>`__. This
  method is more accurate than interpolation but is only suitable for images
  where the field of view is small so that pixels are well approximated by
  rectangles in world coordinates. This is slower but more accurate than
  interpolation for small fields of view.

* **Adaptive resampling**, where care is taken to deal with differing
  resolutions more accurately than in simple interpolation, as described
  in `DeForest (2004) <https://doi.org/10.1023/B:SOLA.0000021743.24248.b0>`_.
  This is more accurate than interpolation, especially when the input and
  output resolutions differ, or when there are strong distortions, for example
  for large areas of the sky or when reprojecting images that include the
  solar limb. This algorithm also applies anti-aliasing, and ultimately
  produces much more accurate photometry than plain interpolation.

* Computing the **exact overlap** of pixels on the sky by treating them as
  **four-sided spherical polygons** on the sky and computing spherical polygon
  intersection. This is essentially an exact form of drizzling, and should be
  appropriate for any field of view. However, this comes at
  a significant performance cost. This is the `algorithm used by the Montage
  package <http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/algorithms.html>`_, and we have
  implemented it here using the same core algorithm. Note that this is only
  suitable for data being reprojected between spherical celestial coordinates on
  the sky that share the same origin (that is, it cannot be used to reproject
  from coordinates on the sky to coordinates on the surface of a spherical
  body).

Currently, this package implements :ref:`interpolation<interpolation>`,
:ref:`adaptive resampling<adaptive>`, and
:ref:`spherical polygon intersection<exact>`.

.. note:: The reprojection/resampling is always done assuming that the image is in
          **surface brightness units**. For example, if you have an image
          with a constant value of 1, reprojecting the image to an image with
          twice as high resolution will result in an image where all pixels
          are all 1. This limitation is due to the interpolation algorithms
          (the fact that interpolation can be used implicitly assumes that
          the pixel values can be interpolated which is only the case with
          surface brightness units). If you have an image in flux units,
          first convert it to surface brightness, then use the functions
          described below. In future, we will provide a convenience function
          to return the area of all the pixels to make it easier.

          However, the :ref:`adaptive resampling<adaptive>` algorithm provides
          an option to conserve flux by appropriately rescaling each output
          pixel. With this option, an image in flux units need not be coverted
          to surface brightness.

.. _common:

Common options
==============

All of the reprojection algorithms implemented in *reproject* are available
as functions named as ``reproject_<algorithm>``, e.g.
:func:`~reproject.reproject_interp`, :func:`~reproject.reproject_adaptive`,
and :func:`~reproject.reproject_exact`. These can be imported from the top-level
of the package, e.g.::

    >>> from reproject import reproject_interp
    >>> from reproject import reproject_adaptive
    >>> from reproject import reproject_exact

All functions share a common set of arguments, as well as including
algorithm-dependent arguments. In this section, we take a look at the common
arguments.

The reprojection functions take two main arguments. The first argument is the
image to reproject, together with WCS information about the image. This can be
either:

* The name of a FITS file
* An :class:`~astropy.io.fits.HDUList` object
* An image HDU object such as a :class:`~astropy.io.fits.PrimaryHDU`,
  :class:`~astropy.io.fits.ImageHDU`, or
  :class:`~astropy.io.fits.CompImageHDU` instance
* A tuple where the first element is a :class:`~numpy.ndarray` and the
  second element is either a :class:`~astropy.wcs.WCS` or a
  :class:`~astropy.io.fits.Header` object

In the case of a FITS file or an :class:`~astropy.io.fits.HDUList` object, if
there is more than one Header-Data Unit (HDU), the ``hdu_in`` keyword argument
is also required and should be set to the ID or the name of the HDU to use.

The second argument is the WCS information for the output image, which should be
specified either as a :class:`~astropy.wcs.WCS` or a
:class:`~astropy.io.fits.Header` instance. If this is specified as a
:class:`~astropy.wcs.WCS` instance, the ``shape_out`` keyword argument should
also be specified, and be given the shape of the output image using the Numpy
``(ny, nx)`` convention (this is because :class:`~astropy.wcs.WCS`, unlike
:class:`~astropy.io.fits.Header`, does not contain information about image
size).

For the interpolation and adaptive algorithms, an optional third argument,
``roundtrip_coords`` is accepted. By default, after coordinates are transformed
from the output plane to the input plane, the input-plane coordinates are
transformed back to the output plane to ensure that the transformation is
defined in both directions. This doubles the amount of
coordinate-transformation work to be done. In speed-critical situations, where
it is known that the coordinate transformation is defined everywhere, this
extra work can be disabled by setting ``roundtrip_coords=False``. (Note that
this is not a question of whether each output pixel maps to an existing *pixel*
in the input image and vice-versa, but whether it maps to a valid *coordinate*
in the coordinate system of the input image---regardless of whether that
coordinate falls within the bounds of the input image.)

As an example, we start off by opening a FITS file using Astropy::

    >>> from astropy.io import fits
    >>> hdu = fits.open('http://data.astropy.org/galactic_center/gc_msx_e.fits')[0]    # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
    Downloading http://data.astropy.org/galactic_center/gc_msx_e.fits [Done]

The image is currently using a Plate CarÃ©e projection::

    >>> hdu.header['CTYPE1']   # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
    'GLON-CAR'

We can create a new header using a Gnomonic projection::

    >>> new_header = hdu.header.copy()   # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
    >>> new_header['CTYPE1'] = 'GLON-TAN'   # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
    >>> new_header['CTYPE2'] = 'GLAT-TAN'   # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA

And finally we can call the :func:`~reproject.reproject_interp` function to reproject
the image using interpolation::

    >>> from reproject import reproject_interp
    >>> new_image, footprint = reproject_interp(hdu, new_header)   # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA

The reprojection functions return two arrays - the first is the reprojected
input image, and the second is a 'footprint' array which shows the fraction of
overlap of the input image on the output image grid. This footprint is 0 for
output pixels that fall outside the input image, 1 for output pixels that fall
inside the input image. For more information about footprint arrays, see the
:doc:`footprints` section. To return only the main array and not the footprint,
you can set ``return_footprint=False``.

We can then easily write out the reprojected image to a new FITS file::

    >>> fits.writeto('reprojected_image.fits', new_image, new_header)   # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA

.. _interpolation:

Interpolation
=============

The :func:`~reproject.reproject_interp` function can be used to carry out
reprojection implemented using simple interpolation::

    >>> from reproject import reproject_interp

In addition to the arguments described in :ref:`common`, the order of the
interpolation can be controlled by setting the ``order=`` argument to either an
integer or a string giving the order of the interpolation. Supported strings
include:

* ``'nearest-neighbor'``: zeroth order interpolation
* ``'bilinear'``: fisst order interpolation
* ``'biquadratic'``: second order interpolation
* ``'bicubic'``: third order interpolation

.. _adaptive:

Adaptive resampling
===================

The :func:`~reproject.reproject_adaptive` function can be used to carry out
anti-aliased reprojection using the  `DeForest (2004)
<https://doi.org/10.1023/B:SOLA.0000021743.24248.b0>`_ algorithm::

    >>> from reproject import reproject_adaptive

This algorithm provides high-quality photometry through anti-aliased
reprojection, which avoids the problems of plain interpolation when the input
and output images have different resolutions, and it offers a flux-conserving
mode.

Options
-------

In addition to the arguments described in :ref:`common`, one can use the
options described below.

A rescaling of output pixel values to conserve flux can be enabled with the
``conserve_flux`` flag. (Flux conservation is stronger with a Gaussian
kernel---see below.)

The kernel used for interpolation and averaging can be controlled with a set of
options. The ``kernel`` argument can be set to 'hann' or 'gaussian' to set the
function being used. The Hann window is the default, and the Gaussian window
improves anti-aliasing and photometric accuracy (or flux conservation, when the
flux-conserving mode is enabled) at the cost of blurring the output image by a
few pixels. The ``kernel_width`` argument sets the width of the Gaussian
kernel, in pixels, and is ignored for the Hann window. This width is measured
between the Gaussian's :math:`\pm 1 \sigma` points. The default value is 1.3
for the Gaussian, chosen to minimize blurring without compromising accuracy.
Lower values may introduce photometric errors or leave input pixels
under-sampled, while larger values may improve anti-aliasing behavior but will
increase blurring of the output image. Since the Gaussian function has infinite
extent, it must be truncated. This is done by sampling within a region of
finite size. The width in pixels of the sampling region is determined by the
coordinate transform and scaled by the ``sample_region_width`` option, and this
scaling represents a trade-off between accuracy and computation speed. The
default value of 4 represents a reasonable choice, with errors in extreme cases
typically limited to less than one percent, while a value of 5 typically reduces
extreme errors to a fraction of a percent. (The ``sample_region_width`` option
has no effect for the Hann window, as that window does not have infinite
extent.)

One can control the calculation of the Jacobian used in this
algorithm with the ``center_jacobian`` flag. The Jacobian matrix represents
how the corresponding input-image coordinate varies as you move between output
pixels (or d(input image coordinate) / d(output image coordinate)), and serves
as a local linearization of the coordinate transformation. When this flag is
``True``, the Jacobian is calculated at pixel grid points by calculating the
transformation at locations offset by half a pixel, and then doing finite
differences on the resulting input-image coordinates. This is more accurate but
carries the cost of tripling the number of coordinate transformed done by this
routine. This is recommended if your coordinate transform varies significantly
and non-smoothly between output pixels. When ``False``, the Jacobian is
calculated using the pixel-grid-point transforms that need to be computed
anyway, which produces Jacobian values at locations between pixel grid points,
and nearby Jacobian values are averaged to produce values at the pixel grid
points. This is more efficient, and the loss of accuracy is extremely small for
transformations that vary smoothly between pixels. The default (``False``) is
to use the faster option.

When, for any one output pixel, the sampling region in the input image
straddles the boundary of the input image or lies entirely outside the input
image, a range of boundary modes can be applied, and this is set with the
``boundary_mode`` option. Allowed values are:

* ``strict`` --- Output pixels will be ``NaN`` if any of their input samples
  fall outside the input image.
* ``constant`` --- Samples outside the bounds of the input image are
  replaced by a constant value, set with the ``boundary_fill_value`` argument.
  Output values become ``NaN`` if there are no valid input samples.
* ``grid-constant`` --- Samples outside the bounds of the input image are
  replaced by a constant value, set with the ``boundary_fill_value`` argument.
  Output values will be ``boundary_fill_value`` if there are no valid input
  samples.
* ``ignore`` --- Samples outside the input image are simply ignored,
  contributing neither to the output value nor the sum-of-weights
  normalization. If there are no valid input samples, the output value will be
  ``NaN``.
* ``ignore_threshold`` --- Acts as ``ignore``, unless the total weight that
  would have been assigned to the ignored samples exceeds a set fraction of the
  total weight across the entire sampling region, set by the
  ``boundary_ignore_threshold`` argument. In that case, acts as ``strict``.
* ``nearest`` --- Samples outside the input image are replaced by the nearst
  in-bounds input pixel.

The input image can also be marked as being cyclic or periodic in the x and/or
y axes with the ``x_cyclic`` and ``y_cyclic`` flags. If these are set, samples
will wrap around to the opposite side of the image, ignoring the
``boundary_mode`` for that axis.


Algorithm Description
---------------------

Broadly speaking, the algorithm works by approximating the footprint of each
output pixel by an elliptical shape in the input image, which is then stretched
and rotated by the transformation (as described by the Jacobian mentioned
above), then finding the weighted average of samples inside that ellipse, where
the shape of the weighting function is given by an analytical distribution.
Hann and Gaussian functions are supported in this implementation, and this
choice of functions produces an anti-aliased reprojection. In cases where an
image is being reduced in resolution, a region of the input image is averaged
to produce each output pixel, while in cases where an image is being magnified,
the averaging becomes a non-linear interpolation between nearby input pixels.
When a reprojection enlarges some regions in the input image and shrinks other
regions, this algorithm smoothly transitions between interpolation and spatial
averaging as appropriate for each individual output pixel (and likewise, the
amount of spatial averaging is adjusted as the scaling factor varies). This
produces high-quality resampling with excellent photometric accuracy.

To illustrate the benefits of this method, we consider a simple case
where the reprojection includes a large change in resolution. We choose
to use an artificial data example to better illustrate the differences:

.. plot::
   :include-source:

    import numpy as np
    from astropy.wcs import WCS
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from reproject import reproject_interp, reproject_adaptive

    # Set up initial array with pattern
    input_array = np.zeros((256, 256))
    input_array[::20, :] = 1
    input_array[:, ::20] = 1
    input_array[10::20, 10::20] = 1

    # Define a simple input WCS
    input_wcs = WCS(naxis=2)
    input_wcs.wcs.crpix = 128.5, 128.5
    input_wcs.wcs.cdelt = -0.01, 0.01

    # Define a lower resolution output WCS with rotation
    output_wcs = WCS(naxis=2)
    output_wcs.wcs.crpix = 30.5, 30.5
    output_wcs.wcs.cdelt = -0.0427, 0.0427
    output_wcs.wcs.pc = [[0.8, 0.2], [-0.2, 0.8]]

    # Reproject using interpolation and adaptive resampling
    result_interp, _ = reproject_interp((input_array, input_wcs),
                                        output_wcs, shape_out=(60, 60))
    result_hann, _ = reproject_adaptive((input_array, input_wcs),
                                         output_wcs, shape_out=(60, 60),
                                         kernel='hann')
    result_gaussian, _ = reproject_adaptive((input_array, input_wcs),
                                            output_wcs, shape_out=(60, 60),
                                            kernel='gaussian')

    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
    plt.subplot(1, 4, 1)
    plt.imshow(input_array, origin='lower', vmin=0, vmax=1, interpolation='hanning')
    plt.tick_params(left=False, bottom=False, labelleft=False, labelbottom=False)
    plt.title('Input array')
    plt.subplot(1, 4, 2)
    plt.imshow(result_interp, origin='lower', vmin=0, vmax=1)
    plt.tick_params(left=False, bottom=False, labelleft=False, labelbottom=False)
    plt.title('reproject_interp')
    plt.subplot(1, 4, 3)
    plt.imshow(result_hann, origin='lower', vmin=0, vmax=0.5)
    plt.tick_params(left=False, bottom=False, labelleft=False, labelbottom=False)
    plt.title('reproject_adaptive\nHann kernel')
    plt.subplot(1, 4, 4)
    plt.imshow(result_gaussian, origin='lower', vmin=0, vmax=0.5)
    plt.tick_params(left=False, bottom=False, labelleft=False, labelbottom=False)
    plt.title('reproject_adaptive\nGaussian kernel')

In the case of interpolation, the output accuracy is poor because, for each
output pixel, we interpolate a single position in the input array which will
fall inside a region where the flux is zero or one, and this is very sensitive
to aliasing effects. For the adaptive resampling, each output pixel is formed
from the weighted average of several pixels in the input, and all input pixels
should contribute to the output, with no gaps. It can also be seen how the
results differ between the Gaussian and Hann kernels. While the Gaussian kernel
blurs the output image slightly, it provides much strong anti-aliasing (as the
rotated grid lines appear much smoother and consistent in brightness from pixel
to pixel).

.. _exact:

Spherical Polygon Intersection
==============================

The :func:`~reproject.reproject_exact` function can be used to carry out 'exact'
reprojection using the spherical polygon intersection of input and output pixels::

    >>> from reproject import reproject_exact

In addition to the arguments described in :ref:`common`, an optional
``parallel=`` option can be used to control whether to parallelize the
reprojection, and if so how many cores to use (see
:func:`~reproject.reproject_exact` for more details). For this algorithm, the
footprint array returned gives the exact fractional overlap of new pixels with
the original image (see :doc:`footprints` for more details).

.. warning:: The :func:`~reproject.reproject_exact` is currently known to
             have precision issues for images with resolutions <0.05". For
             now it is therefore best to avoid using it with such images.

Very large datasets
===================

If you have a very large dataset to reproject, i.e., any normal IFU or radio
spectral cube with many individual spectral channels - you may not be able to
hold two copies of the dataset in memory.  In this case, you can specify an
output memory mapped array to store the data. For now this only works with the
interpolation reprojection methods.

.. doctest-skip::

    >>> outhdr = fits.Header.fromtextfile('cube_header_gal.hdr')
    >>> shape = (outhdr['NAXIS3'], outhdr['NAXIS2'], outhdr['NAXIS1'])
    >>> outarray = np.memmap(filename='output.np', mode='w+', shape=shape, dtype='float32')
    >>> hdu = fits.open('cube_file.fits')
    >>> rslt = reproject.reproject_interp(hdu, outhdr, output_array=outarray,
    ...                                   return_footprint=False,
    ...                                   independent_celestial_slices=True)
    >>> newhdu = fits.PrimaryHDU(data=outarray, header=outhdr)
    >>> newhdu.writeto('new_cube_file.fits')

Or if you're dealing with FITS files, you can skip the numpy memmap step and use `FITS large file creation
<http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/generated/examples/io/skip_create-large-fits.html>`_.

.. doctest-skip::

    >>> outhdr = fits.Header.fromtextfile('cube_header_gal.hdr')
    >>> outhdr.tofile('new_cube.fits')
    >>> shape = tuple(outhdr['NAXIS{0}'.format(ii)] for ii in range(1, outhdr['NAXIS']+1))
    >>> with open('new_cube.fits', 'rb+') as fobj:
    >>>     fobj.seek(len(outhdr.tostring()) + (np.product(shape) * np.abs(outhdr['BITPIX']//8)) - 1)
    >>>     fobj.write(b'\0')
    >>> outhdu = fits.open('new_cube.fits', mode='update')
    >>> rslt = reproject.reproject_interp(hdu, outhdr, output_array=outhdu[0].data,
    ...                                   return_footprint=False,
    ...                                   independent_celestial_slices=True)
    >>> outhdu.flush()
